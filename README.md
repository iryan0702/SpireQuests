## Contributions
Either modargo, Mindbomber or I (erasels) will be reviewing your pull request and suggesting changes to code and/or design and balance if needed to keep the project cohesive. Be aware that even after code is merged, maintainers may need to make bug fixes and balance changes as we get feedback (we'll do our best to consult contributors for balance changes). Collaborating with others to make a contribution is fine.

### Contribution guidelines
To make suitable content and help the PR process go smoothly, follow these guidelines:
- We expect contributions to be complete (including art) before merging, but it's okay to make a PR while still working on the art

#### Cards, relics, powers, etc.
Cards, relics, powers, patches, and everything else should go in the package you created for your quest.

There are abstract classes that you should extend in the abstracts package: `AbstractSQCard`, `AbstractSQRelic`, and `AbstractSQPower`.
